Machine learning gained a significant position in healthcare services (HCS) due to its ability to improve the disease prediction in HCS. Machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence have already been worked in the HCS area. Recently, diabetes is a notable public chronic disease worldwide. It is growing rapidly because of bad lifestyles, taking more junk food and also lake of health awareness. Therefore, there is a need of framework that can effectively track and monitor people's diabetes and health condition within an application view. In this study, I have proposed a framework for real time diabetes prediction, monitoring and application (DPMA). The objective is to develop an optimized and efficient machine learning (ML) application which can effectually recognize and predict the condition of the diabetes.
